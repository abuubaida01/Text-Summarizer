after your dreambut you persevered you show character doshow courage and that sets you apartfrom the rest[Music]that's what it's all about it's neverabout the prize it's not the money it'sthe pride the pride in knowing you gaveevery ounce of your soul the pride inknowing you made you the pride inknowing you made you great that's whatit's all about your comfort zone is yourenemyone of the biggest irony's I can thinkof is when you live life trying to staycomfortable life will send you more andmore discomfort it's true life will sendyou more and more problems because lifewill keep throwing rocks at you lifewill keep handing you resistancestruggles issues and because people areso concerned about staying comfortableinstead of growing and reaching higherbecause people don't want to addresstheir limitations and move beyond themthey keep struggling listen you are nothere on this planet to sip applemartinis on the beach and get yourself atank you are here to grow and if youwon't make yourself uncomfortable thelife will give you plenty of reasons topush you out your comfort zone so youhave one of two options either youcommit to constant growth and feelingdiscomfort upon your own accord and youbecome the master of your own destiny oryou hand over the keys and you let lifehappen to you by default one path leadsto success and the other path leads youto constant struggling pain it's yourchoice you think Steve Jobs startedApple feeling comfortable about ityou think top athletes sleep their wayto high performance you thinkoscar-winning actors procrastinatedtheir way to achievement Nowhy are you giving into wasting timewith Netflix marathons and decryprocrastination why are you running tothe bar the moment your best friendtakes you to come out you have got to bewilling to make the hard decision you'vegot to be willing to feel uncomfortableto feel awkward to face rejection tofail to feel pressure you've got to bewilling to face those things becausethat's what's necessary for you to growhow many times you looked at your lifeand said man if only I knew then what Iknow now I live my life so differentlyso is it not possible then that the lifeyou are living now you would be livingdifferently if you began to develop anawareness that you do not currently havewell guess what the only way for you todevelop knowledge and awareness is totry things you have not yet tried to dothings you have not yet done to createthings you are not yet created to go toplaces you have not yet explored this ishow you grow that is how you become theperson who is worthy of sitting on thebeach with their favorite drink lifewill reward you with those experiencesafter you do the work there is a realprice of success and life collects thepayments and let me tell you somethinglife does not accept payment plans lifedoes not let you get away withexperiencing things that you have notyet earned your sacrifice must be paidupfront and in full and that is the onlyway you are going to
